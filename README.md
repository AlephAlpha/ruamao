# 挼猫

I don't know what I'm writing. A simple statically typed concatenative programming language embedded in Rust, maybe.

Inspired by [Joy](https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/joy.html), [Cat](https://github.com/cdiggins/cat-language), [Kitten](https://kittenlang.org), and [*Why concatenative programming matters*](https://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html).

The name 挼猫 (ruá māo) means "rubbing a cat" in Chinese.
